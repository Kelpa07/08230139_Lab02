              <h3>Project One</h3>
              <p>My first project after joining this college. I was part of up shift program where we had to put forward an innovation of our own and present it at a exhibition. our group worked on an automated irrigation system where a person could irrigate their fields from their phones automatically. It was fun and engaging.</p>

              <h3>Project Two</h3>
              <p>This project was based on our PSY module. There we learned about audino systems and basic electrical components. Based on that knowledge we were asked to work on a project. So, I and four other members of my group made this automated water alert system. It detects the water level as it rises and sends out a loud alarm alerting nearby people. It was a simple project where we could showcase our creativity.</p>

              <h3>Project Three</h3>
              <p>A project made to improve the security in our homes. This project was the most successful one so far. It was approved by the Tutor and we got relevent comments. This was also diffucult to make since it required complex electrical knowledge. We sought help from profresional and could finish this work.</p>
